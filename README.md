# Raphael

The code in this repository was created by Meera Limaye and Natasha Dietzler.

Two folders are contained in this repo: starter_code and end_code.

The starter_code folder is meant for users to have a base code to start from when watching the Raphael tutorial that we created for INFO 343. Please view the YouTube video at this url: 

The end_code is the final product of the examples given in that video and is meant to be used for reference purposes.
